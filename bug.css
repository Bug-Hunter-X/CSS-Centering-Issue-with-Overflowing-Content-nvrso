The following CSS rule might cause unexpected behavior in certain browsers:

```css
div {
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 50%;
}
```

This code intends to center a div horizontally. However, if the div's content is wider than 50% of the parent container's width, the `width: 50%;` will have no effect, and the element will not be properly centered.
