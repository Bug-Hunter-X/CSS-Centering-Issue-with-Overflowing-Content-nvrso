Several solutions exist to reliably center a div, even when its content overflows the specified width.  Here are two using Flexbox and Grid:

**Solution 1: Using Flexbox**

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  width: 50%;
  height: 100px; /*Example height*/
}
```

This approach uses flexbox to center both horizontally and vertically.

**Solution 2: Using Grid**

```css
div {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  width: 50%;
  height: 100px; /*Example height*/
}
```

This solution uses grid for a concise way to achieve the same centering effect.
